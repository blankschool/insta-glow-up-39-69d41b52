## Supabase Edge Functions (backend)

Backend lives in `supabase/functions/`.

### Dev/Test: fixed Instagram account (no OAuth)

For debugging with a single fixed Instagram Business account/token, you can seed `connected_accounts` for the logged-in user via the `seed-test-account` Edge Function.

- Set function secrets (Supabase CLI): `supabase secrets set TEST_IG_USER_ID=... TEST_IG_ACCESS_TOKEN=... TEST_IG_USERNAME=...`
- Invoke while logged in: `supabase.functions.invoke('seed-test-account')`

### Dev/Test: auto-login (local)

For local development, you can auto-login a test user (email/password) and optionally auto-seed the fixed account on startup.

1) Create a test user (terminal; requires email confirmations disabled in Supabase Auth settings):

`curl -sS -X POST "$VITE_SUPABASE_URL/auth/v1/signup" -H "apikey: $VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"email":"test@example.com","password":"strong-password"}'`

2) Create `./.env.local` (do NOT commit):

`VITE_DEV_TEST_EMAIL=test@example.com`

`VITE_DEV_TEST_PASSWORD=strong-password`

`VITE_DEV_SEED_TEST_ACCOUNT=true`

3) Run the app: `npm run dev`
